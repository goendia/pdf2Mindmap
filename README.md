WIP - This is a work in progress, no clean code at all.

I am currently attending a course on Udemy called "CompTIA Network+ N10-009".
As i am only learning through mind maps and the provided study guide was provided in an unstructured format (PDF), I wrote this script to convert it into a structured format that can be used to create a mind map.

I used docling to convert the PDF into a JSON file.

It was quickly done as my time is restricted and i need to focus on learning.
